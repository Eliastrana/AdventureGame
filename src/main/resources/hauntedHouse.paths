::Room inspection
You take a closer look at the room. There are spider webs in the corners, and a layer of dust covers everything. You notice a faint musty smell in the air.

[Inspect the desk](Desk inspection)

::Desk inspection
You approach the desk and notice that there are several papers scattered about. Some of them are handwritten notes, while others are pages torn from a book. You pick up one of the notes and read it. It says, "Beware of the spirits that haunt this house. They will not rest until they have claimed another soul." You hear a faint whisper coming from behind the door you just entered.
